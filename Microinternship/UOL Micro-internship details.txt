1. Have a look at other universities NSS and compare, what tactic they use for keeping students to answer survey - social media channel 

Loughborough
 - doesn't have incentives for students (NSS)
 - utilises social media to engage students and share information about the NSS - strong communication and engaging words like e.g., "Shape the future of your course" or "Your voice matters."
 - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat 
Warwick
 - 2 x £100 EdenRed vouchers, 8 x £50 EdenRed vouchers, 75 x £20 EdenRed vouchers - 
 - or departments can spend up to a maximum of £5 per student - Charitable schemes and Prize schemes
 - shows which area has improved listed to see the improvements and initiatives we’ve introduced, as a direct result of the NSS
 - Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram
Birmingham
 - Survey of sexual misconduct along with NSS (optional) (DO NOT COPY BUT FIND SOMETHING SIMILAR)
 - Students cannot complete the sexual misconduct survey if they have not completed the NSS
 - prize draw as an incentive for students to participate in the National Student Survey (NSS). 
   Eligible students who complete the survey will be entered into a draw for a chance to win one of five £150 cash prizes.
 - Instagram and TikTok to remind students to complete the NSS by the April 30th deadline

Warwick: Has different induction/welcome pathways for new UGs, returning UGs, new PGTs, and PGRs.

Birmingham: Sends separate emails to UGs and PGs; continuing students get re-registration info, not a "welcome" email in the same tone as new starters.

Loughborough: First-year UGs receive a welcome pack + email; returners receive re-enrolment and module confirmation details, not a full-blown “welcome.”

how we've worded it or displayed for the users
 - use more general terms for prizes, I'm not sure if everyone would be appealed to only food and drink vouchers.


 
2. UPay App explore functionality (data) to make it better - (food and drink team)



3. Forward thank you completion email from Ipsos to student-surveys@le.ac.uk - what to do with these data? visualize and track ( write down a guide )

 - Can be used to confirm the amount of users who have completed the survey which can be used to form a visualisation or tracking on completion rates
 - However, I do think that using an automated email which confirms a user after survey submission is more efficient
 - Can be used to track who deserves the incentives such as vouchers though, the email must have a confirmation number like student ID to differentiate users. 
 

budget, vouchers, survey problems, communication, data.
